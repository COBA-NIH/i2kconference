## About

Discovery in the life-sciences increasingly relies on quantitative analysis of microscopy images. The 2022 virtual event “From Images to Knowledge (I2K)”, to be held from May 6th, 9th and 10th, will therefore feature talks and in-depth interactive workshops covering state-of-the-art open-source solutions for biological image reconstruction and analysis, as well as social interaction between developers, researchers, and students. It will be an event to learn about and discuss forward looking strategies for dealing with the ever-increasing amount of large and content rich microscopy imagery.

As all major open-source platforms for bioimage analysis will be represented including many in the [image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/), this will be a great opportunity to learn how to use the best software tools for your research and how to get involved in their development! We will have an exciting range of developers and adopters in the field of computational image analysis participating in the workshop, both as tutors and social participants.
