## About

Discovery in the life-sciences increasingly relies on quantitative analysis of microscopy images. The 2022 virtual workshop “From Images to Knowledge (I2K)”, to be held from May 6th, 9th and 10th, will therefore focus on in-depth interactive tutorials covering state-of-the-art open source solutions for biological image reconstruction and analysis, as well as social interaction between developers, researchers, and students. It will be a forum to learn about and discuss forward looking strategies for dealing with the ever increasing amount of large and content rich microscopy imagery.

As all major open source platforms for bioimage analysis will be represented, this will be a great opportunity to learn how to use the best software tools for your research and how to get involved in their development! We will have an exciting number of leaders and rising stars in the field of computational image analysis participating in the workshop, both as tutors and social participants. I2K will therefore be a unique chance to get in touch with them in person.

Topics will include:

* Bioimage analysis workflows
* Computer vision and machine learning
* Handling of big image data
* Image data annotation and sharing
* Image data visualisation
* Image restoration, registration, segmentation, and tracking
* Smart microscopy
* Open software engineering

I2K is for (i) researchers and students who are generating or analysing large and/ or complex image data, (ii) scientists creating tools and methods to solve image analysis problems, and (iii) software engineers who provide and maintain the necessary infrastructure.
