## About

Discovery in the life-sciences increasingly relies on quantitative analysis of microscopy images. The 2024 I2K conference, to be held from **October 23th-25th** at the [Human Technopole](https://humantechnopole.it/en/) in **Milan, Italy**, will therefore feature in-depth interactive workshops covering state-of-the-art open-source solutions for biological image reconstruction and analysis. It will be an event to learn about and discuss forward looking strategies for dealing with the ever-increasing amount of large and content rich microscopy imagery. 

As all major open-source platforms for bioimage analysis will be represented including many in the [image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/), this will be a great opportunity to learn how to use the best software tools for your research and how to get involved in their development! We will have an exciting range of developers and adopters in the field of computational image analysis participating in the workshop, both as tutors and participants.

**Stay tuned for the abstract submission and registration opening!**
